PROBLEM: The local coffee shop seeks to increase customers using a website to promote sales. The coffee shop seeks to enhance their brand with a simple, mobile-first, website that showcases their coffee. This is a single landing page layout with different sections and a variety of functionalities such as a load/hide sidebar, responsive buttons and google map embedded frame. This coffee landing page is just an example of what could be achieved for a customer in relatively small time as an initial prototype. The landing page consists of: Home, About, Work, and Contact.

ACTION: To prototype the website, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used to quickly create the layout of the website. The website follows a responsible design approach and can be easily shown on a smart phone, a tablet and a regular Desktop computer.

SOLUTION: The main slider of the Home page shows a video in the background for the regular and tablet screen. The shop name is displayed with a stylistic, bold font. The About section features a custom grid display of carefully chosen images and text. To account for mobile devices, the text and images scale according to the width of the page. Hover effects are used to indicate clickable objects and a modal is displayed using JavaScript eventListeners in order to enlarge the clicked image. The customer can provide name and lastname for additional perks such as a free coffee, additional discount and much more, depending on the business owner interests. The name, or nickname, of the customer is then randomly chosen to give these perks.

Description: Responsive HTML, CSS, JavaScript theme for a coffee shop business. The present landing page could be a good choice for a small business. For medium businesses additional features can be added and additional pages can be implemented for a great customer experience.
